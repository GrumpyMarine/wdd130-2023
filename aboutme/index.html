    <p>Hello everyone, I am Jason Kiger and I live in Southern California in Los Angeles. I am married to my beautiful wife and have six boys (my oldest is 24, 19, 17, 14, 11, and 9). I am currently getting my Bachelors Degree in Software Developement and I am looking forward to working with my wife together, to create wwebsites and have our own business.I love doing activities with my family like camping, hiking, exploring, and going to the beach. My wife and I have been married for 20 hard but beautiful years. I am currently employed doing law enforcement, and I have 4 years before I can retire. Which i am excited about because I want to do something less dangerous and strenuous to my body, getting older sucks. Lol.</p>
    <p>One of the things I love about starting a career in Software Developement is i will be able to be home more and spend more time with my family. I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ for fifteen years. I dont have a favorite quote, because they all mean something different to me. My favorite scripture is James 1:5, it helped me realize I needed to ask the Lord with an honest heart and open mind. In life we come across so many different people in our lives from various countries, that we wonder why or how we have such a strong instant connection with. I have a firm belief, Heavenly Father has created a plan or path for all of us. We were meant to meet for a reasons, we will never know. The why or how is not important, it is the what that matters. What do we do with the time we have together. I am excited to see the friendships that come from this class and the classes to come.  </p>
