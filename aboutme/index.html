    <h2>XBX Gamertag: GrumpyMarine784 and my Github Nickname: GrumpyMarine</h2>
    <p>Greetings, my name is Jason Kiger and I currently live in Southern California near Los Angeles. I have been married to my beautiful wife for 20 years and we have six boys (my oldest is 24, 19, 17, 14, 11, and 9). I am currently persuing my Bachelors Degree in Software Developement. I am looking forward to working together with my wife, to create wwebsites and have our own business. I love doing activities with my family, such as camping, hiking, exploring, and going to the beach. I am currently employed with the local law enforcement department teaching computer classes (nothing related to programming), and in 4 years I can retire from this career and start my web design full time. Which i am excited about because I want to do something that is less dangerous and strenuous on my body, getting older sucks. LoL.</p>
    <p>One of the things I love about starting a career in Software Developement is that I will be able to be home more, allowing me to spend more time with my family. I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Later Day Saints for fifteen years. I dont have a favorite quote, because they all mean something different to me. My favorite scripture is James 1:5, it helped me realize I needed to ask the Lord with an honest heart and open mind. In life we come across so many different people in our lives from various countries, that we wonder why or how we have such a strong instant connection with. I have a firm belief, Heavenly Father has created a plan or path for all of us. The people we come in contact in our lives, were meant to be in our lives for a reasons. We night not always understand the purpose, it may be for you or it may be for them, we will never know. The why or how is not important, it is the "what" that matters. What do we do with the time we have together. I am excited to see the friendships that come from this class and the classes to come.  </p>
