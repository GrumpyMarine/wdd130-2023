    Who We Are:
    <p>
      Hi-Desert Iris and Daylily is a 503(c)(3) non-profit corporation and an educational organization with a goal of
      promoting Iris and Daylily as a drought-tolerant plant suitable for growing in a desert environment. We are an
      affiliate of the American Iris Society, Region 15 and founded April 1988.

      We live in a desert surrounded by dry to dead plants and lots of dirt. With the education and teamwork of our
      organization, we would like to show others the beauty of the desert when you add the Irises and Daylily’s.
    </p>

    Purpose:
    <p>
      The website's purpose is to create awareness of the Hi-Desert Iris and Daylily Society and to build and increase
      friendships amongst members of the community. We plan to use this website to bridge the social gap between the
      youth, young adults, mature adults, and senior citizens. We will be using the website to publish a membership
      directory, upcoming meetings, social events to include planting, growing, and selling. This website will benefit
      all levels of society by creating a place where people can get together and never feel alone.
    </p>
    Calendar:
    <p>
      Inside the Calendar, you will have access to upcoming meetings to include dates, start times, and locations. A
      second option will be social events to include planting parties, growing classes, and fundraising events by
      selling Irises and Daylily's.

    <h3>Planting and Zones</h3>

    Planting:
    <p>
      In this section, we will discuss the different zones, and show a map of the zones. Depending on your climate zone,
      this will determine what types of Irises and Daylily’s can be grown. Each zone differs based on the average annual
      minimum winter temperature, divided into 10-degree F zones, and further divided into 5-degree F half-zones. We
      will discuss how to plant the rhizome (bulb), maintain the flower, and replant from an existing plant. We will
      discuss the various parts of the plant.
    </p>
    Types and Parts of the Iris:
    <p>
      We will discuss the diverse types of Irises and Daylily’s. There are regular, historic, and then custom types and
      names. There are about 280 varied species of Irises in the world. Many of them are native to Europe and Asia.
      Within the United States there are 28 native species. We will also identify the different parts of an Iris.
