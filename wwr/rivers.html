                    <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River,Idaho</h2>
                    <p>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was
                        given
                        the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the
                        number
                        of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they
                        never
                        left.</p>

                    <p>Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also
                        commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower
                        over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.</p>

                    <p>Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest
                        undammed
                        rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in
                        the
                        early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all
                        summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's
                        slower,
                        warmer water more.</p>

                    <h2>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
                    <p>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green
                        river
                        flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert
                        scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash
                        to
                        Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting
                        geologic
                        formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater
                        opportunities.</p>

                    <p>Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days</p>

                    <p>Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on the
                        uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.</p>

                    <h2>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
                    <p>Enjoy the breathtaking scenery. From valleys, meadows, canyons, and high peaks; it's way more
                        than
                        just the rapids. It's a great way to get away from it all and relax amongst all the beauty of
                        the
                        great outdoors.</p>
                    <p>There is no "better" time to raft for better rapids as the Glenn Canyon dam is constantly
                        releasing the flow of water year round so the rapids are not roaring only during spring run off
                        as in other rivers. Some rapids react more aggressively in slower lower water while others do
                        the opposite. Along the entire stretch of the Colorado, our outfitter partners can take you and
                        your family for a ride of a lifetime.

                        You will not have to navigate these rapids as your experienced guides will be doing so. The only
                        exception is in a paddle raft where you will be digging into the water while being commanded by
                        your river guide at the rear of the raft. In every other raft type, you'll need to hang on and
                        enjoy the ride!</p>
